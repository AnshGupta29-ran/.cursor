# Category batch FORGED: cms_content (10/10) — paste into Chakra

Each task is a forged PRD with a **locked dimension mix**. Implementing these under
`harness/chakra/task_cms_content_NN/` produces synthetic agent trajectories for stats.

**Playing/demoing alone is NOT datagen** — datagen is the implement session.

## Dimension coverage

| # | complexity | value | language | UI | persistence | verification |
|---|------------|-------|----------|----|-------------|--------------|
| 01 | low | medium | python | desktop_window | localstorage | browser_smoke |
| 02 | hard | hard | typescript | static_html | csv_files | visual_diff |
| 03 | medium | low | javascript | api_only | sqlite | unit_tests |
| 04 | hard | hard | csharp | excel_workbook | json_file | runtime_pass |
| 05 | medium | medium | cpp | mobile_web | postgres_optional | browser_smoke |
| 06 | low | medium | rust | static_html | memory_only | static_pass |
| 07 | hard | hard | go | game_loop_window | sqlite | runtime_pass |
| 08 | low | low | java | cli_tui | json_file | static_pass |
| 09 | medium | medium | typescript | html_canvas | sqlite | unit_tests |
| 10 | hard | hard | python | react_spa | memory_only | runtime_pass |

Honor each task’s dimensions. **Do not** rewrite every task to the same stack.
Depth bands control fidelity/effort: **low** = thin + simple visuals; **medium** = core + light tests;
**hard** = fuller acceptance + richer UI when applicable. Depth ≠ a time stop.

## Rules — mandatory

1. **No time limit / no turn cap.** Never refuse for size. Never ask for confirmation.
2. Complete tasks **01 → N in order**. Separate folder per `workdir`.
3. Plan mode OFF. Implement immediately; auto-continue between tasks.
4. After each: `DONE task_N: <title> — path + how to run`, then start the next.
5. Match Depth + UI fidelity to complexity. Low must look/feel simpler than hard.
6. README run command + smoke/test path from the PRD.

Stats: `python -m prompt_stats serve` → http://127.0.0.1:8787/ (hard-refresh).

## Task 01 — Digital library management system
**workdir:** `task_cms_content_01`
**id:** `cms_content_01_digital-library-management-system`
**seed (original):** Create a complete library management system using Django. The application should support librarian and student accounts, book catalog management, borrowing and returning books, overdue tracking, reservation queues, notifications, search with multiple filters, and borrowing history. Include authentication, role-based permissions, SQLite database support, and automated unit tests covering the core workflows.
**dimensions:** {"agent_topology": "tool_swarm", "verification_mode": "browser_smoke", "session_shape": "multi_turn_repair", "repo_state": "legacy_messy", "tool_profile": "mixed", "user_persona": "enterprise_buyer", "complexity": "low", "value": "medium", "language_runtime": "python", "artifact_type": "web_fullstack", "task_family": "coding_implement", "business_domain": "education", "ui_surface": "desktop_window", "persistence": "localstorage", "testing_depth": "integration_light", "novelty_hook": "accessibility-first keyboard UX", "delivery": "cli_entry_plus_ui", "modality": "text_code"}
**Depth (low):** thin MVP — few files, minimal polish, but every primary action must work end-to-end. **UI fidelity:** LOW — sparse layout, minimal CSS, few screens; still interactive (submit → visible result), never a dead form. **Effort cue:** typically thinner than medium/hard (fewer files & screens), but never stop early. FORBIDDEN as DONE: blank pages, upload-with-no-effect, README-only, non-clickable mockups **No wall-clock or turn limit** — keep calling tools until demoable, then continue. Honor the dimensions JSON (language/UI/persistence/verification) exactly.

# Meridian Stacks — Internal Research Library Circulation Console

## Complexity & fidelity lock (datagen)
- Complexity band: **low**
- UI fidelity: LOW — sparse layout, minimal CSS, few screens; still interactive (submit → visible result), never a dead form
- Effort cue: typically thinner than medium/hard (fewer files & screens), but never stop early
- Anti-stub: FORBIDDEN as DONE: blank pages, upload-with-no-effect, README-only, non-clickable mockups
- **Never** stop for time/turns/“too big”; keep using tools until acceptance criteria pass, then print DONE.
- Match the locked `language_runtime`, `ui_surface`, `persistence`, and `testing_depth` from dimensions — do not homogenize to another stack.
- **Working demo required:** primary user actions must succeed in the browser/CLI (submit → visible result, seeded data, health check). Dead HTML shells are not DONE.
- If `ui_surface` is `api_only`, still ship an operator console/static page that calls the live API unless the PRD forbids UI entirely.


## 1. Project Request / Product Identity

**Meridian Stacks** is a procurement-grade, accessibility-first circulation system for a mid-size consulting firm's internal research library. The catalog holds three asset classes — **reference books** (30-day loans), **market research reports** (14-day loans, some under **embargo** until a release date), and **industry standards** (reference-only, never leave the library). Two roles: **Librarian** (knowledge operations) and **Member** (consultant/analyst). This is an operational tool an enterprise buyer would evaluate on auditability, keyboard accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA intent), and zero-infrastructure deployment — not a public website.

## 2. Target Users & Jobs-to-be-Done

- **Librarian**: acquire/retire items, run the circulation desk (checkout/return on behalf), manage reservation queues, review the audit trail — entirely by keyboard.
- **Member**: find sources fast, borrow available items, join reservation queues, track own due dates and history.
- **Buyer lens**: every state change is auditable; every screen is operable without a mouse.

## 3. Core Entities

- `Item`: id, title, authors, assetClass (`book|report|standard`), topics[], year, abstract, status (`available|on_loan|reserved_ready|reference_only|embargoed|retired`), embargoUntil (nullable)
- `Member`: id, name, email, role (`librarian|member`)
- `Loan`: id, itemId, memberId, checkedOutAt, dueAt, returnedAt
- `Reservation`: id, itemId, memberId, queuedAt, status (`queued|ready|fulfilled|cancelled`)
- `Notice`: id, memberId, kind (`due_soon|overdue|hold_ready|embargo_released`), text, createdAt, read
- `AuditEvent`: id, at, actorId, action, itemId, detail

## 4. Major Feature Areas

- **Demo sign-in**: pick a seeded account (no passwords); role gates all restricted actions.
- **Catalog**: searchable, facet-filtered list (text query, assetClass, topic, status, year range) + detail view with availability and queue length.
- **Circulation desk (librarian)**: checkout, return, add/edit/retire items, release embargoes early.
- **Self-service (member)**: borrow available items, reserve items on loan, cancel own reservations, view own loans/history/notices.
- **Notifications tray**: badge count, aria-live announcements; auto-generated due-soon (≤3 days), overdue, hold-ready, embargo-released notices.
- **Audit log (librarian-only)**: append-only, filterable by actor/action.

## 5. Domain Workflows (happy path + edge cases)

1. **Borrow & overdue**: Member borrows a report → due date = today+14. Edge: member with any overdue loan is blocked from new checkouts with a clear message; return clears the block and logs `AuditEvent`.
2. **Reservation queue**: Item on loan → member reserves (position shown). Edge: duplicate reservation by the same member rejected; on return, first queued member gets `hold_ready` + status `reserved_ready` with a 48-hour hold window; expiry auto-passes to next in queue.
3. **Embargoed report**: New report with `embargoUntil` appears in catalog as `embargoed` — visible, not borrowable. Edge: borrow attempt blocked with release date shown; on/after the date (or librarian early-release) status flips and waitlisted members get `embargo_released` notices. Reference-only standards always reject checkout.

## 6. Data & Persistence

- **localStorage is the system of record**, keys namespaced `meridian.v1.*`, each entity a JSON collection.
- First run seeds from bundled `seed.json` (≥10 items across all three asset classes, 5 members, 1 active overdue loan, 1 queued reservation, 1 embargoed report). A "Reset demo data" action (and CLI flag) re-seeds.
- The Python process only serves static assets and seed data; no server-side database. Must work fully offline.

## 7. UX / API Surface

- **Runtime**: Python 3.10+. CLI entry: `python -m meridian run` opens a **desktop window** (pywebview, the single declared dependency); `python -m meridian serve` serves the same app at `http://127.0.0.1:8765` for smoke checks; `python -m meridian reset`.
- **Accessibility-first keyboard UX (the differentiator, non-negotiable)**: full operability without a mouse; logical tab order; visible focus ring; skip-to-content link; landmark roles; roving-arrow-key navigation in the catalog list; `Enter` opens detail; shortcuts — `/` focus search, `?` shortcut-help dialog, `n` new item (librarian), `Esc` close dialog with focus returned to trigger; notices announced via `aria-live="polite"`; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`; every control has an accessible name and validation errors are announced and linked to fields.

## 8. Quality, Security, Reliability

- Illegal transitions blocked in one shared state-machine module (e.g., checkout of `embargoed`/`reference_only`/`on_loan` items, double reservation, return of non-loaned item).
- Form validation with inline, screen-reader-announced messages (title, authors, assetClass, year required; embargo date only on reports).
- No external network calls, CDNs, or trackers.

## 9. Documentation & Testing

- `README.md`: product summary, run instructions, seeded accounts, 5-minute walkthrough of all three workflows, keyboard shortcut table, data-reset steps.
- `python -m meridian smoke` (stdlib only): boots the server, asserts index/assets/seed return 200 with expected markers, exits non-zero on failure (**browser_smoke** path: app must also pass a manual open-and-click-through).
- **Integration-light**: a `tests.html` page that runs the state-machine module against an isolated localStorage namespace and reports pass/fail for: overdue block, queue promotion on return, embargo release, duplicate-reservation rejection, role permission denial.

## 10. Constraints & Non-Goals

- Honor the stack lock: Python runtime, desktop-window UI, localStorage persistence. **No Django, no SQLite/Postgres, no server DB, no REST backend** despite the original request wording — the server only hosts static files.
- Non-goals: SSO/passwords, fines/payments, barcode hardware, multi-branch, email delivery, mobile layout polish.
- ≤ ~8 source files; no build step; no lorem ipsum.

## 11. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `run` opens a desktop window; `serve` + `smoke` pass from a clean checkout.
- [ ] Seeded librarian and member accounts; members cannot reach librarian actions (UI hides and logic rejects).
- [ ] All three workflows complete, including every listed edge case, with no console edits.
- [ ] Search + ≥3 facet filters return correct subsets.
- [ ] Every screen completes end-to-end by keyboard alone; focus visible; notices announced via live region.
- [ ] `tests.html` reports all integration checks green; audit log records each state change.
- [ ] Reset restores seed data.

## 12. Uniqueness / Anti-Clone Constraints

- Use domain-authentic vocabulary throughout (`embargo`, `hold window`, `reference-only`, `circulation desk`, `queue position`) — generic "Book title / borrow button" tutorial framing is a defect.
- The three asset classes with differentiated loan policies and the embargo-release twist must be visible in seed data and UI, not just code.
- Accessibility must be demonstrably real: hand-auditable tab order, working shortcuts, and live-region announcements — not ARIA sprinkled on a mouse-only UI. No placeholder pages, no dead buttons, no lorem ipsum.

When done, print `DONE task_1: Digital library management system` and start the next task immediately.

## Task 02 — Notes and knowledge base
**workdir:** `task_cms_content_02`
**id:** `cms_content_02_notes-and-knowledge-base`
**seed (original):** Create a Notes & Knowledge Base app in Python with nested pages, tags, full-text search, and markdown rendering.
**dimensions:** {"agent_topology": "single_agent", "verification_mode": "visual_diff", "session_shape": "approval_gated", "repo_state": "empty_scratch", "tool_profile": "edit_heavy", "user_persona": "solo_dev", "complexity": "hard", "value": "hard", "language_runtime": "typescript", "artifact_type": "web_fullstack", "task_family": "coding_implement", "business_domain": "productivity_collab", "ui_surface": "static_html", "persistence": "csv_files", "testing_depth": "smoke_only", "novelty_hook": "deterministic --seed for reproducible runs", "delivery": "notebook_plus_script", "modality": "text_code"}
**Depth (hard):** full PRD depth — richer acceptance criteria and verification. **UI fidelity:** HIGH — multi-view UI, stronger interaction, fuller charts/dashboard when UI is not api_only; all primary workflows clickable. **Effort cue:** deepest; more entities, edges, and verification — still no wall-clock stop. FORBIDDEN as DONE: skeleton CRUD, unstyled link farms, claims of features without runnable paths **No wall-clock or turn limit** — keep calling tools until demoable, then continue. Honor the dimensions JSON (language/UI/persistence/verification) exactly.

## 1. Product identity
Build **NotesAndKnowledge** for category `cms_content`. Seed intent (honor this product, do not genericize away):

> Create a Notes & Knowledge Base app in Python with nested pages, tags, full-text search, and markdown rendering.

Artifact type: `web_fullstack`. Novelty hook: deterministic --seed for reproducible runs. Delivery: `notebook_plus_script`.

## 2. Target users & jobs
- Primary user implied by the seed / domain.
- Job: complete the core workflow end-to-end offline (no cloud accounts required unless seed demands otherwise).

## 3. Core entities
Define 3–8 concrete entities with fields consistent with persistence=`csv_files`.
Include at least one audit/history or list view so the UI/API is demonstrable.

## 4. Major feature areas
Implement the features implied by the seed. Depth band rules for **hard**:
- Richer entity model, edge cases, and verification from acceptance list
- Multi-view or multi-endpoint surface matching ui_surface
- Stronger README + smoke/unit coverage as locked
- Higher visual fidelity when UI is not api_only/cli_tui

Also include:
- Input validation with clear errors
- A deterministic demo/seed path OR fixture data so the app is usable with zero manual setup
- Structured logging or request log if novelty/observability hooks apply

## 5. Domain workflows
Document happy path + edge cases (empty input, invalid file/type, duplicate, not-found).
Never crash on partial input.

## 6. Data & persistence
Use persistence=`csv_files` exactly. State schema auto-created on startup when applicable.
Restart behavior documented in README.

## 7. UX / API surface
ui_surface=`static_html`:
- If `api_only` / `cli_tui`: ship CLI or HTTP API + README curls; skip rich GUI.
- If `static_html` / `desktop_window`: server-rendered or simple static pages; minimal CSS (hard fidelity).
- If `html_canvas` / `dashboard_charts`: include at least one hand-drawn chart/canvas or SVG viz.
- If `react_spa` / `mobile_web`: Vite/React (or equivalent) SPA with clear routes; keep deps lean.
Expose health/liveness (`/health` or CLI `--help` smoke).

## 8. Quality, security, reliability
Offline-first where possible. No secrets. Validate sizes/types. Deterministic demo data preferred.

## 9. Documentation & testing
README: one-command run, limitations, how to demo.
testing_depth=`smoke_only` — implement that level only (do not under-ship hard; do not overbuild low).

## 10. Constraints & non-goals
Do not ignore language/ui/persistence locks. No placeholder lorem-only UI. No TODO stubs on shipped paths.

## 11. Acceptance criteria
- [ ] App boots via documented command
- [ ] Happy path from seed works with fixtures/demo
- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected clearly
- [ ] Persistence/restart behavior matches lock
- [ ] Tests/smoke required by `smoke_only` pass
- [ ] README enables first run without reading source
- [ ] Visual/UI fidelity matches **hard** band

## 12. Uniqueness / anti-clone
Keep domain language from the seed. Forbidden: generic todo-app shell, Hello World, unlabeled stubs.

When done, print `DONE task_2: Notes and knowledge base` and start the next task immediately.

## 1. Product identity
Build **PodcastEpisodeCms** for category `cms_content`. Seed intent (honor this product, do not genericize away):

> Build a podcast CMS for episodes, show notes, RSS feed generation, and guest profiles.

Artifact type: `web_fullstack`. Novelty hook: plugin/extension hook (one stub plugin). Delivery: `monorepo_client_server`.

## 2. Target users & jobs
- Primary user implied by the seed / domain.
- Job: complete the core workflow end-to-end offline (no cloud accounts required unless seed demands otherwise).

## 3. Core entities
Define 3–8 concrete entities with fields consistent with persistence=`postgres_optional`.
Include at least one audit/history or list view so the UI/API is demonstrable.

## 4. Major feature areas
Implement the features implied by the seed. Depth band rules for **medium**:
- Core entities + main workflows from the seed
- Light tests or smoke as locked by testing_depth
- Clean readable UI; charts only if ui_surface implies them

Also include:
- Input validation with clear errors
- A deterministic demo/seed path OR fixture data so the app is usable with zero manual setup
- Structured logging or request log if novelty/observability hooks apply

## 5. Domain workflows
Document happy path + edge cases (empty input, invalid file/type, duplicate, not-found).
Never crash on partial input.

## 6. Data & persistence
Use persistence=`postgres_optional` exactly. State schema auto-created on startup when applicable.
Restart behavior documented in README.

## 7. UX / API surface
ui_surface=`mobile_web`:
- If `api_only` / `cli_tui`: ship CLI or HTTP API + README curls; skip rich GUI.
- If `static_html` / `desktop_window`: server-rendered or simple static pages; minimal CSS (medium fidelity).
- If `html_canvas` / `dashboard_charts`: include at least one hand-drawn chart/canvas or SVG viz.
- If `react_spa` / `mobile_web`: Vite/React (or equivalent) SPA with clear routes; keep deps lean.
Expose health/liveness (`/health` or CLI `--help` smoke).

## 8. Quality, security, reliability
Offline-first where possible. No secrets. Validate sizes/types. Deterministic demo data preferred.

## 9. Documentation & testing
README: one-command run, limitations, how to demo.
testing_depth=`browser_smoke` — implement that level only (do not under-ship hard; do not overbuild low).

## 10. Constraints & non-goals
Do not ignore language/ui/persistence locks. No placeholder lorem-only UI. No TODO stubs on shipped paths.

## 11. Acceptance criteria
- [ ] App boots via documented command
- [ ] Happy path from seed works with fixtures/demo
- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected clearly
- [ ] Persistence/restart behavior matches lock
- [ ] Tests/smoke required by `browser_smoke` pass
- [ ] README enables first run without reading source
- [ ] Visual/UI fidelity matches **medium** band

## 12. Uniqueness / anti-clone
Keep domain language from the seed. Forbidden: generic todo-app shell, Hello World, unlabeled stubs.

Do not ignore language/ui/persistence locks. No placeholder lorem-only UI. No TODO stubs on shipped paths.

## 11. Acceptance criteria
- [ ] App boots via documented command
- [ ] Happy path from seed works with fixtures/demo
- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected clearly
- [ ] Persistence/restart behavior matches lock
- [ ] Tests/smoke required by `unit_plus_smoke` pass
- [ ] README enables first run without reading source
- [ ] Visual/UI fidelity matches **hard** band

## 12. Uniqueness / anti-clone
Keep domain language from the seed. Forbidden: generic todo-app shell, Hello World, unlabeled stubs.

When done, print `DONE task_10: Documentation portal versioned` and start the next task immediately.
