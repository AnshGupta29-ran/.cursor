# Category batch FORGED: ecommerce (10/10) — paste into Chakra

Each task is a forged PRD with a **locked dimension mix**. Implementing these under
`harness/chakra/task_ecommerce_NN/` produces synthetic agent trajectories for stats.

**Playing/demoing alone is NOT datagen** — datagen is the implement session.

## Dimension coverage

| # | complexity | value | language | UI | persistence | verification |
|---|------------|-------|----------|----|-------------|--------------|
| 01 | medium | medium | typescript | html_canvas | sqlite | unit_tests |
| 02 | hard | hard | python | react_spa | memory_only | runtime_pass |
| 03 | low | medium | javascript | desktop_window | localstorage | browser_smoke |
| 04 | hard | hard | csharp | static_html | csv_files | visual_diff |
| 05 | medium | low | java | api_only | sqlite | unit_tests |
| 06 | hard | hard | typescript | excel_workbook | json_file | runtime_pass |
| 07 | medium | medium | go | mobile_web | postgres_optional | browser_smoke |
| 08 | low | medium | python | static_html | memory_only | static_pass |
| 09 | hard | hard | excel_office | excel_workbook | sqlite | runtime_pass |
| 10 | low | low | typescript | cli_tui | json_file | static_pass |

Honor each task’s dimensions. **Do not** rewrite every task to the same stack.
Depth bands control fidelity/effort: **low** = thin + simple visuals; **medium** = core + light tests;
**hard** = fuller acceptance + richer UI when applicable. Depth ≠ a time stop.

## Rules — mandatory

1. **No time limit / no turn cap.** Never refuse for size. Never ask for confirmation.
2. Complete tasks **01 → N in order**. Separate folder per `workdir`.
3. Plan mode OFF. Implement immediately; auto-continue between tasks.
4. After each: `DONE task_N: <title> — path + how to run`, then start the next.
5. Match Depth + UI fidelity to complexity. Low must look/feel simpler than hard.
6. README run command + smoke/test path from the PRD.

Stats: `python -m prompt_stats serve` → http://127.0.0.1:8787/ (hard-refresh).

## Task 01 — E-commerce inventory and orders
**workdir:** `task_ecommerce_01`
**id:** `ecommerce_01_e-commerce-inventory-and-orders`
**seed (original):** Create a full-stack inventory management system using React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. Administrators should be able to manage products, categories, suppliers, inventory levels, purchase orders, and customer orders. Include dashboards with analytics, low-stock alerts, pagination, filtering, authentication, and REST APIs with proper validation. Write automated backend tests for critical endpoints.
**dimensions:** {"agent_topology": "subagent_spawns", "verification_mode": "unit_tests", "session_shape": "multi_turn_repair", "repo_state": "empty_scratch", "tool_profile": "shell_heavy", "user_persona": "staff_eng", "complexity": "medium", "value": "medium", "language_runtime": "typescript", "artifact_type": "web_fullstack", "task_family": "coding_implement", "business_domain": "ecommerce", "ui_surface": "html_canvas", "persistence": "sqlite", "testing_depth": "unit_light", "novelty_hook": "must include a live demo mode with sample data", "delivery": "docker_compose_optional", "modality": "text_code"}
**Depth (medium):** solid MVP — core features + light tests/smoke, avoid gold-plating. **UI fidelity:** MEDIUM — clear multi-panel layout, core interactions that mutate state, seeded demo data, light charts if required. **Effort cue:** deeper than low; still ship demoable without endless polish. FORBIDDEN as DONE: single bare form, API with no operator console, static HTML that does not call live endpoints Build-first: implement from PRD; forbid WebSearch/WebFetch and repo-wide fishing; code > research **No wall-clock or turn limit** — keep calling tools until demoable, then continue.

# ECommerceInventory — E-commerce inventory and orders

## Complexity & fidelity lock (datagen)
- Complexity band: **medium**
- UI fidelity: MEDIUM — clear multi-panel layout, core interactions that mutate state, seeded demo data, light charts if required
- Effort cue: deeper than low; still ship demoable without endless polish
- Anti-stub: FORBIDDEN as DONE: single bare form, API with no operator console, static HTML that does not call live endpoints
- **Never** stop for time/turns/“too big”; keep using tools until acceptance criteria pass, then print DONE.
- Match the locked `language_runtime`, `ui_surface`, `persistence`, and `testing_depth` from dimensions — do not homogenize to another stack.
- **Working demo required:** primary user actions must succeed in the browser/CLI (submit → visible result, seeded data, health check). Dead HTML shells are not DONE.
- If `ui_surface` is `api_only`, still ship an operator console/static page that calls the live API unless the PRD forbids UI entirely.
- **Build-first (anti time-waste):** Implement immediately from this PRD. Forbidden: WebSearch/WebFetch, browsing docs sites, winget/ripgrep installs for searching, Explore/research subagents, Grep/Glob fishing across sibling tasks. At most 2 targeted reads inside this task workdir before Write/Edit. Low = few files shipped fast — do not gold-plate.


## 1. Product identity
Build **ECommerceInventory** for category `ecommerce`. Seed intent (honor this product, do not genericize away):

> Create a full-stack inventory management system using React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. Administrators should be able to manage products, categories, suppliers, inventory levels, purchase orders, and customer orders. Include dashboards with analytics, low-stock alerts, pagination, filtering, authentication, and REST APIs with proper validation. Write automated backend tests for critical endpoints.

Artifact type: `web_fullstack`. Novelty hook: must include a live demo mode with sample data. Delivery: `docker_compose_optional`.

## 2. Target users & jobs
- Primary user implied by the seed / domain.
- Job: complete the core workflow end-to-end offline (no cloud accounts required unless seed demands otherwise).

## 3. Core entities
Define 3–8 concrete entities with fields consistent with persistence=`sqlite`.
Include at least one audit/history or list view so the UI/API is demonstrable.

## 4. Major feature areas
Implement the features implied by the seed. Depth band rules for **medium**:
- Core entities + main workflows from the seed
- Light tests or smoke as locked by testing_depth
- Clean readable UI; charts only if ui_surface implies them

Also include:
- Input validation with clear errors
- A deterministic demo/seed path OR fixture data so the app is usable with zero manual setup
- Structured logging or request log if novelty/observability hooks apply

## 5. Domain workflows
Document happy path + edge cases (empty input, invalid file/type, duplicate, not-found).
Never crash on partial input.

## 6. Data & persistence
Use persistence=`sqlite` exactly. State schema auto-created on startup when applicable.
Restart behavior documented in README.

## 7. UX / API surface
ui_surface=`html_canvas`:
- If `api_only` / `cli_tui`: ship CLI or HTTP API + README curls; skip rich GUI.
- If `static_html` / `desktop_window`: server-rendered or simple static pages; minimal CSS (medium fidelity).
- If `html_canvas` / `dashboard_charts`: include at least one hand-drawn chart/canvas or SVG viz.
- If `react_spa` / `mobile_web`: Vite/React (or equivalent) SPA with clear routes; keep deps lean.
Expose health/liveness (`/health` or CLI `--help` smoke).

## 8. Quality, security, reliability
Offline-first where possible. No secrets. Validate sizes/types. Deterministic demo data preferred.

## 9. Documentation & testing
README: one-command run, limitations, how to demo.
testing_depth=`unit_light` — implement that level only (do not under-ship hard; do not overbuild low).

## 10. Constraints & non-goals
Do not ignore language/ui/persistence locks. No placeholder lorem-only UI. No TODO stubs on shipped paths.

## 11. Acceptance criteria
- [ ] App boots via documented command
- [ ] Happy path from seed works with fixtures/demo
- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected clearly
- [ ] Persistence/restart behavior matches lock
- [ ] Tests/smoke required by `unit_light` pass
- [ ] README enables first run without reading source
- [ ] Visual/UI fidelity matches **medium** band

## 12. Uniqueness / anti-clone
Keep domain language from the seed. Forbidden: generic todo-app shell, Hello World, unlabeled stubs.

When done, print `DONE task_1: E-commerce inventory and orders` and start the next task immediately.

## Task 02 — Restaurant ordering system
**workdir:** `task_ecommerce_02`
**id:** `ecommerce_02_restaurant-ordering-system`
**seed (original):** Create a Restaurant Ordering System in Python: menu, cart, order statuses, kitchen view, and basic payments stub.

**Depth (hard):** full PRD depth — richer acceptance criteria and verification. **UI fidelity:** HIGH — multi-view UI, stronger interaction, fuller charts/dashboard when UI is not api_only; all primary workflows clickable. **Effort cue:** deepest; more entities, edges, and verification — still no wall-clock stop. FORBIDDEN as DONE: skeleton CRUD, unstyled link farms, claims of features without runnable paths Build-first still applies: no online research loops; deepen the product with Write/Edit, not Explore agents **No wall-clock or turn limit** — keep calling tools until demoable, then continue. Honor the dimensions JSON (language/UI/persistence/verification) exactly.

## 8. Quality, security, reliability
Offline-first where possible. No secrets. Validate sizes/types. Deterministic demo data preferred.

## 9. Documentation & testing
README: one-command run, limitations, how to demo.
testing_depth=`unit_light` — implement that level only (do not under-ship hard; do not overbuild low).

## 10. Constraints & non-goals
Do not ignore language/ui/persistence locks. No placeholder lorem-only UI. No TODO stubs on shipped paths.

## 11. Acceptance criteria
- [ ] App boots via documented command

- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected clearly
- [ ] Persistence/restart behavior matches lock
- [ ] Tests/smoke required by `unit_light` pass

## Complexity & fidelity lock (datagen)
- Complexity band: **hard**
- UI fidelity: HIGH — multi-view UI, stronger interaction, fuller charts/dashboard when UI is not api_only; all primary workflows clickable
- Effort cue: deepest; more entities, edges, and verification — still no wall-clock stop
- Anti-stub: FORBIDDEN as DONE: skeleton CRUD, unstyled link farms, claims of features without runnable paths
- **Never** stop for time/turns/“too big”; keep using tools until acceptance criteria pass, then print DONE.
- Match the locked `language_runtime`, `ui_surface`, `persistence`, and `testing_depth` from dimensions — do not homogenize to another stack.
- **Working demo required:** primary user actions must succeed in the browser/CLI (submit → visible result, seeded data, health check). Dead HTML shells are not DONE.
- If `ui_surface` is `api_only`, still ship an operator console/static page that calls the live API unless the PRD forbids UI entirely.
- **Build-first (anti time-waste):** Implement immediately from this PRD. Forbidden: WebSearch/WebFetch, browsing docs sites, winget/ripgrep installs for searching, Explore/research subagents, Grep/Glob fishing across sibling tasks. At most 2 targeted reads inside this task workdir before Write/Edit. Low = few files shipped fast — do not gold-plate.


## 1. Product identity
Build **MarketplaceListingsFor** for category `ecommerce`. Seed intent (honor this product, do not genericize away):

> Build a craft marketplace: seller listings, buyer search/filters, orders, and simple ratings.

Artifact type: `web_fullstack`. Novelty hook: observability: structured logs + simple metrics endpoint. Delivery: `worker_plus_api`.

## 2. Target users & jobs
- Primary user implied by the seed / domain.
- Job: complete the core workflow end-to-end offline (no cloud accounts required unless seed demands otherwise).

## 3. Core entities
Define 3–8 concrete entities with fields consistent with persistence=`json_file`.
Include at least one audit/history or list view so the UI/API is demonstrable.

## 4. Major feature areas
Implement the features implied by the seed. Depth band rules for **hard**:
- Richer entity model, edge cases, and verification from acceptance list
- Multi-view or multi-endpoint surface matching ui_surface
- Stronger README + smoke/unit coverage as locked
- Higher visual fidelity when UI is not api_only/cli_tui

Also include:
- Input validation with clear errors
- A deterministic demo/seed path OR fixture data so the app is usable with zero manual setup
- Structured logging or request log if novelty/observability hooks apply

## 5. Domain workflows
Document happy path + edge cases (empty input, invalid file/type, duplicate, not-found).
Never crash on partial input.

## 6. Data & persistence
Use persistence=`json_file` exactly. State schema auto-created on startup when applicable.
Restart behavior documented in README.

## 7. UX / API surface
ui_surface=`excel_workbook`:
- If `api_only` / `cli_tui`: ship CLI or HTTP API + README curls; skip rich GUI.
- If `static_html` / `desktop_window`: server-rendered or simple static pages; minimal CSS (hard fidelity).
- If `html_canvas` / `dashboard_charts`: include at least one hand-drawn chart/canvas or SVG viz.
- If `react_spa` / `mobile_web`: Vite/React (or equivalent) SPA with clear routes; keep deps lean.
Expose health/liveness (`/health` or CLI `--help` smoke).

## 8. Quality, security, reliability
Offline-first where possible. No secrets. Validate sizes/types. Deterministic demo data preferred.

## 9. Documentation & testing
README: one-command run, limitations, how to demo.
testing_depth=`unit_plus_smoke` — implement that level only (do not under-ship hard; do not overbuild low).

## 10. Constraints & non-goals
Do not ignore language/ui/persistence locks. No placeholder lorem-only UI. No TODO stubs on shipped paths.

## 11. Acceptance criteria
- [ ] App boots via documented command
- [ ] Happy path from seed works with fixtures/demo
- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected clearly
- [ ] Persistence/restart behavior matches lock
- [ ] Tests/smoke required by `unit_plus_smoke` pass

**Depth (medium):** solid MVP — core features + light tests/smoke, avoid gold-plating. **UI fidelity:** MEDIUM — clear multi-panel layout, core interactions that mutate state, seeded demo data, light charts if required. **Effort cue:** deeper than low; still ship demoable without endless polish. FORBIDDEN as DONE: single bare form, API with no operator console, static HTML that does not call live endpoints Build-first: implement from PRD; forbid WebSearch/WebFetch and repo-wide fishing; code > research **No wall-clock or turn limit** — keep calling tools until demoable, then continue.

Offline-first where possible. No secrets. Validate sizes/types. Deterministic demo data preferred.

## 9. Documentation & testing
README: one-command run, limitations, how to demo.
testing_depth=`smoke_only` — implement that level only (do not under-ship hard; do not overbuild low).

## 10. Constraints & non-goals
Do not ignore language/ui/persistence locks. No placeholder lorem-only UI. No TODO stubs on shipped paths.

## 11. Acceptance criteria
- [ ] App boots via documented command
- [ ] Happy path from seed works with fixtures/demo
- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected clearly
- [ ] Persistence/restart behavior matches lock
- [ ] Tests/smoke required by `smoke_only` pass
- [ ] README enables first run without reading source
- [ ] Visual/UI fidelity matches **low** band

## 12. Uniqueness / anti-clone
Keep domain language from the seed. Forbidden: generic todo-app shell, Hello World, unlabeled stubs.

When done, print `DONE task_10: POS lite for cafe` and start the next task immediately.
