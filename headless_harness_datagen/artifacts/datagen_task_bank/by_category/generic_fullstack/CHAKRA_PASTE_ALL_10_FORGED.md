# Category batch FORGED: generic_fullstack (10/10) — paste into Chakra

Each task is a forged PRD with a **locked dimension mix**. Implementing these under
`harness/chakra/task_generic_fullstack_NN/` produces synthetic agent trajectories for stats.

**Playing/demoing alone is NOT datagen** — datagen is the implement session.

## Dimension coverage

| # | complexity | value | language | UI | persistence | verification |
|---|------------|-------|----------|----|-------------|--------------|
| 01 | medium | medium | python | mobile_web | postgres_optional | browser_smoke |
| 02 | low | medium | typescript | static_html | memory_only | static_pass |
| 03 | hard | hard | javascript | game_loop_window | sqlite | runtime_pass |
| 04 | low | low | csharp | cli_tui | json_file | static_pass |
| 05 | medium | medium | cpp | html_canvas | sqlite | unit_tests |
| 06 | hard | hard | rust | react_spa | memory_only | runtime_pass |
| 07 | low | medium | go | desktop_window | localstorage | browser_smoke |
| 08 | hard | hard | java | static_html | csv_files | visual_diff |
| 09 | medium | low | typescript | api_only | sqlite | unit_tests |
| 10 | hard | hard | python | excel_workbook | json_file | runtime_pass |

Honor each task’s dimensions. **Do not** rewrite every task to the same stack.
Depth bands control fidelity/effort: **low** = thin + simple visuals; **medium** = core + light tests;
**hard** = fuller acceptance + richer UI when applicable. Depth ≠ a time stop.

## Rules — mandatory

1. **No time limit / no turn cap.** Never refuse for size. Never ask for confirmation.
2. Complete tasks **01 → N in order**. Separate folder per `workdir`.
3. Plan mode OFF. Implement immediately; auto-continue between tasks.
4. After each: `DONE task_N: <title> — path + how to run`, then start the next.
5. Match Depth + UI fidelity to complexity. Low must look/feel simpler than hard.
6. README run command + smoke/test path from the PRD.

Stats: `python -m prompt_stats serve` → http://127.0.0.1:8787/ (hard-refresh).

**Depth (medium):** solid MVP — core features + light tests/smoke, avoid gold-plating. **UI fidelity:** MEDIUM — clear multi-panel layout, core interactions that mutate state, seeded demo data, light charts if required. **Effort cue:** deeper than low; still ship demoable without endless polish. FORBIDDEN as DONE: single bare form, API with no operator console, static HTML that does not call live endpoints **No wall-clock or turn limit** — keep calling tools until demoable, then continue.

# HospitalAppointmentManagement — Hospital appointment management

## Complexity & fidelity lock (datagen)
- Complexity band: **medium**
- UI fidelity: MEDIUM — clear multi-panel layout, core interactions that mutate state, seeded demo data, light charts if required
- Effort cue: deeper than low; still ship demoable without endless polish
- Anti-stub: FORBIDDEN as DONE: single bare form, API with no operator console, static HTML that does not call live endpoints
- **Never** stop for time/turns/“too big”; keep using tools until acceptance criteria pass, then print DONE.
- Match the locked `language_runtime`, `ui_surface`, `persistence`, and `testing_depth` from dimensions — do not homogenize to another stack.
- **Working demo required:** primary user actions must succeed in the browser/CLI (submit → visible result, seeded data, health check). Dead HTML shells are not DONE.
- If `ui_surface` is `api_only`, still ship an operator console/static page that calls the live API unless the PRD forbids UI entirely.


## 1. Product identity
Build **HospitalAppointmentManagement** for category `generic_fullstack`. Seed intent (honor this product, do not genericize away):

> Create a Hospital Appointment Management system: doctors, patients, slots, bookings, cancellations, and reminders stub.

Artifact type: `web_fullstack`. Novelty hook: plugin/extension hook (one stub plugin). Delivery: `monorepo_client_server`.

## 2. Target users & jobs
- Primary user implied by the seed / domain.
- Job: complete the core workflow end-to-end offline (no cloud accounts required unless seed demands otherwise).

## 3. Core entities
Define 3–8 concrete entities with fields consistent with persistence=`postgres_optional`.
Include at least one audit/history or list view so the UI/API is demonstrable.

## 4. Major feature areas
Implement the features implied by the seed. Depth band rules for **medium**:
- Core entities + main workflows from the seed
- Light tests or smoke as locked by testing_depth
- Clean readable UI; charts only if ui_surface implies them

Also include:
- Input validation with clear errors
- A deterministic demo/seed path OR fixture data so the app is usable with zero manual setup
- Structured logging or request log if novelty/observability hooks apply

## 5. Domain workflows
Document happy path + edge cases (empty input, invalid file/type, duplicate, not-found).
Never crash on partial input.

## 6. Data & persistence
Use persistence=`postgres_optional` exactly. State schema auto-created on startup when applicable.
Restart behavior documented in README.

## 7. UX / API surface
ui_surface=`mobile_web`:
- If `api_only` / `cli_tui`: ship CLI or HTTP API + README curls; skip rich GUI.
- If `static_html` / `desktop_window`: server-rendered or simple static pages; minimal CSS (medium fidelity).
- If `html_canvas` / `dashboard_charts`: include at least one hand-drawn chart/canvas or SVG viz.
- If `react_spa` / `mobile_web`: Vite/React (or equivalent) SPA with clear routes; keep deps lean.
Expose health/liveness (`/health` or CLI `--help` smoke).

## 8. Quality, security, reliability
Offline-first where possible. No secrets. Validate sizes/types. Deterministic demo data preferred.

## 9. Documentation & testing
README: one-command run, limitations, how to demo.
testing_depth=`browser_smoke` — implement that level only (do not under-ship hard; do not overbuild low).

## 10. Constraints & non-goals
Do not ignore language/ui/persistence locks. No placeholder lorem-only UI. No TODO stubs on shipped paths.

## 11. Acceptance criteria
- [ ] App boots via documented command
- [ ] Happy path from seed works with fixtures/demo
- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected clearly
- [ ] Persistence/restart behavior matches lock
- [ ] Tests/smoke required by `browser_smoke` pass
- [ ] README enables first run without reading source
- [ ] Visual/UI fidelity matches **medium** band

## 12. Uniqueness / anti-clone
Keep domain language from the seed. Forbidden: generic todo-app shell, Hello World, unlabeled stubs.

When done, print `DONE task_1: Hospital appointment management` and start the next task immediately.

**Depth (low):** thin MVP — few files, minimal polish, but every primary action must work end-to-end. **UI fidelity:** LOW — sparse layout, minimal CSS, few screens; still interactive (submit → visible result), never a dead form. **Effort cue:** typically thinner than medium/hard (fewer files & screens), but never stop early. FORBIDDEN as DONE: blank pages, upload-with-no-effect, README-only, non-clickable mockups **No wall-clock or turn limit** — keep calling tools until demoable, then continue.

# HelpdeskTicketSystem — Helpdesk ticket system

## Complexity & fidelity lock (datagen)
- Complexity band: **hard**
- UI fidelity: HIGH — multi-view UI, stronger interaction, fuller charts/dashboard when UI is not api_only; all primary workflows clickable
- Effort cue: deepest; more entities, edges, and verification — still no wall-clock stop
- Anti-stub: FORBIDDEN as DONE: skeleton CRUD, unstyled link farms, claims of features without runnable paths
- **Never** stop for time/turns/“too big”; keep using tools until acceptance criteria pass, then print DONE.
- Match the locked `language_runtime`, `ui_surface`, `persistence`, and `testing_depth` from dimensions — do not homogenize to another stack.
- **Working demo required:** primary user actions must succeed in the browser/CLI (submit → visible result, seeded data, health check). Dead HTML shells are not DONE.
- If `ui_surface` is `api_only`, still ship an operator console/static page that calls the live API unless the PRD forbids UI entirely.


## 1. Product identity
Build **HelpdeskTicketSystem** for category `generic_fullstack`. Seed intent (honor this product, do not genericize away):

> Build a helpdesk ticket system with priorities, SLA timers, agent assignment, and canned responses.

Artifact type: `web_fullstack`. Novelty hook: offline-first; no cloud accounts. Delivery: `one_command_dev_server`.

## 2. Target users & jobs
- Primary user implied by the seed / domain.
- Job: complete the core workflow end-to-end offline (no cloud accounts required unless seed demands otherwise).

## 3. Core entities
Define 3–8 concrete entities with fields consistent with persistence=`memory_only`.
Include at least one audit/history or list view so the UI/API is demonstrable.

## 4. Major feature areas
Implement the features implied by the seed. Depth band rules for **hard**:
- Richer entity model, edge cases, and verification from acceptance list
- Multi-view or multi-endpoint surface matching ui_surface
- Stronger README + smoke/unit coverage as locked
- Higher visual fidelity when UI is not api_only/cli_tui

Also include:
- Input validation with clear errors
- A deterministic demo/seed path OR fixture data so the app is usable with zero manual setup
- Structured logging or request log if novelty/observability hooks apply

## 5. Domain workflows
Document happy path + edge cases (empty input, invalid file/type, duplicate, not-found).
Never crash on partial input.

## 6. Data & persistence
Use persistence=`memory_only` exactly. State schema auto-created on startup when applicable.
Restart behavior documented in README.

## 7. UX / API surface
ui_surface=`react_spa`:
- If `api_only` / `cli_tui`: ship CLI or HTTP API + README curls; skip rich GUI.
- If `static_html` / `desktop_window`: server-rendered or simple static pages; minimal CSS (hard fidelity).
- If `html_canvas` / `dashboard_charts`: include at least one hand-drawn chart/canvas or SVG viz.
- If `react_spa` / `mobile_web`: Vite/React (or equivalent) SPA with clear routes; keep deps lean.
Expose health/liveness (`/health` or CLI `--help` smoke).

## 8. Quality, security, reliability
Offline-first where possible. No secrets. Validate sizes/types. Deterministic demo data preferred.

## 9. Documentation & testing
README: one-command run, limitations, how to demo.
testing_depth=`unit_plus_smoke` — implement that level only (do not under-ship hard; do not overbuild low).

## 10. Constraints & non-goals
Do not ignore language/ui/persistence locks. No placeholder lorem-only UI. No TODO stubs on shipped paths.

## 11. Acceptance criteria
- [ ] App boots via documented command
- [ ] Happy path from seed works with fixtures/demo
- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected clearly
- [ ] Persistence/restart behavior matches lock
- [ ] Tests/smoke required by `unit_plus_smoke` pass
- [ ] README enables first run without reading source
- [ ] Visual/UI fidelity matches **hard** band

## 12. Uniqueness / anti-clone
Keep domain language from the seed. Forbidden: generic todo-app shell, Hello World, unlabeled stubs.

When done, print `DONE task_6: Helpdesk ticket system` and start the next task immediately.

**Depth (low):** thin MVP — few files, minimal polish, but every primary action must work end-to-end. **UI fidelity:** LOW — sparse layout, minimal CSS, few screens; still interactive (submit → visible result), never a dead form. **Effort cue:** typically thinner than medium/hard (fewer files & screens), but never stop early. FORBIDDEN as DONE: blank pages, upload-with-no-effect, README-only, non-clickable mockups **No wall-clock or turn limit** — keep calling tools until demoable, then continue.
